# Bookstore Project

Employees at a rare bookstore need to be able to access a system where 
they can store the inventory for the store. The system should be 
accessible from either a laptop or a tablet. Employees should be able to 
add, update, and delete books from the system. Not all employees should 
be able to delete books from the system.

The Rare Bookstore client’s have indicated that they will require the 
ability to view a list of their books. The ability to search through the 
list to find books based on their price, Author’s name, and Book’s title 
has been requested. They would also like to sort the list based on the 
book details that they provided during the interviews in Phase 1. Your 
team has devised a set of tests to validate the ability to search through 
visual lists and grids to find a value. They also have devised a test to 
validate sorting a visual

### **Stage 1: Empathise**
Based on what was discussed in the interview I have created profiles for each employee:
**Owner**

1. Responsibilities: Oversee inventory at multiple locations, review inventory reports, and the ability to do complete his employee responsibilities
2. Current system frustrations: Must compile all lists on paper to track inventory
3. Task timeline: Quarterly basis or as need be
4. Changing the system would improve efficiency leading to satisfaction.

**Manager**

1. Responsibilities: Enter new books into the system, delete books due to error or at their discretion, track sub-employees usage of the site, and add new employees to the system 
2. Current system frustrations: Has to edit inventory on paper and keep track of paperwork
3. Task timeline: Daily
4. Changing the system would decrease the time it takes to update and delete inventory which would make the Manager happy.

**Staff**

1. Responsibilities: Any available staff member can add books to the system and update information if need be
2. Current system frustrations: Every book that is added to inventory must be written down
3. Task timeline: Daily
4. Changing the system would mean faster processing times leading to staff happiness

### Stage 2: Define

1. Create an inventory system that allows the owner to track inventory at multiple locations
2. Adapt a login interface that allows all users(owner, manager, and staff) to utilize the site with unique usernames and passwords. 
3. Create an automated system that marks items as sold by staff as quantity decreases until sold out while remaining in the system unless deleted by managers.
4. Define search parameters that can be used by managers and staff to look up books and pricing.
5. Adapt security features such as locking when idle for when managers and staff walk away from the screen.
6. Create a form that allows managers and staff to add information about books to the site.
7. Create an admin login for the owner to utilize and assign usernames to managers.
8. Create a system that allows managers to create and delete  usernames for staff 
9. Create a specific page with only access granted to managers to see how staff uses the website
